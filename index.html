                    <dt>Who is eligible?</dt>
                    <dd>Individuals who have attended a Sustainable Med conference. They also must reside within the
                        country
                        where the grant would be administered.</dd>
                    <dt>What do we fund?</dt>
                    <dd>Projects that will advance the stated vision and goals of Sustainable Medical Missions. Priority
                        will be
                        given to projects specifically addressing neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and conditions as
                        well as
                        strengthening partnerships between the healthcare community and local churches. All projects
                        must be
                        related to improving community health or medical care.</dd>
                    <dt>What will we not fund?</dt>
                    <dd>Activities unrelated to healthcare or promoting the gospel. Activities that would exclude or
                        bring harm
                        to people of any gender, race, religion, ethnicity, class or sexual orientation. Funds cannot be
                        used to
                        offer or provide money, gifts or other things of value directly or indirectly to anyone in order
                        to
                        improperly influence any act or decision relating to Sustainable Med or the project, including
                        assisting
                        any party to secure an improper advantage. Funds cannot be used for any personal expenses
                        (housing,
                        food, and clothing) or for personal gain.</dd>
                    <dt>How can someone apply for funds?</dt>
                    <dd>Applicants must complete a proposal no longer than two pages (one-sided, single spaced, 10 pt or
                        greater
                        font). Citations and references are encouraged and can be included in addition to the two-page
                        application. Please describe the following: What is your idea? What is the intended impact or
                        outcomes?
                        How will you test or measure this? What is your Zero in on Zero grid(s) for the disease(s)?</dd>
                    <dd>Proposals must be submitted to Sustainable Med for review. Submissions should be emailed to <a
                            href="mailto:grants@sustainablemed.org">grants@sustainablemed.org</a> or mailed to P.O. Box
                        498493,
                        Cincinnati, OH, 45249, USA.</dd>
                    <dt>When can they apply for funds?</dt>
                    <dd>Applications can be submitted at any time, but all must be received by September 1 each year.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>How often can someone apply for funds?</dt>
                    <dd>Two times in a calendar year.</dd>
                    <dt>Is there a maximum award amount? If so, how much?</dt>
                    <dd>Average grant award will be $500-$750 USD for first time and pilot grants. Those who have
                        completed
                        their pilot projects successfully with Sustainable Med and are moving to larger scale are able
                        to apply
                        for larger grants with a maximum award of around $5,000 USD.</dd>
                    <dt>What are the selection criteria?</dt>
                    <dd>The following criteria will be used to determine which grants are awarded (all criteria are
                        equally
                        weighted in terms of importance)
                        <ol>
                            <li>Accountability – Who else in the community will be able to confirm the funds were used
                                as
                                described? What measures are in place to assure the integrity of funds?</li>
                            <li>Collaboration – What other organizations or groups are involved? What church is involved
                                in the
                                project? How will the local community be engaged?</li>
                            <li>Sustainability – How will the project and its related activities continue once the grant
                                funds
                                are gone?</li>
                            <li>Innovation – What is unique about this project? (Can be an entirely new idea or just new
                                to an
                                area)</li>
                            <li>Gospel spreading – How does this project advance the spreading of the Gospel?</li>
                            <li>Clarity – Are the ideas and concepts clearly described with concrete plans?</li>
                            <li>Impact – Number of people affected by the project.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>What reporting will be required?</dt>
                    <dd>Establishing and maintaining relationships are a key value for Sustainable Medical Missions.
                        Thus,
                        consistent communication is essential. All grant recipients will need to communicate at least
                        one time a
                        month with Sustainable Med staff via email, phone, video conferencing or social media. A final
                        report
                        (2-3 pages, single spaced, one-sided, 10 pt or greater font) will be required within 60 days of
                        the
                        completion of the grant. The final report form will be provided by Sustainable Med to each grant
                        recipient and will include questions such as: What actually occurred with the grant funds? Who
                        was
                        impacted? What actually changed as a result of the grant (aka “outcomes”)? What were some of the
                        obstacles you encountered? What is next with the project activities and the communities being
                        served?
                    </dd>
                    <dd>Grant recipients who do not maintain consistent communication or who do not complete the final
                        report in
                        a timely manner will likely not be eligible for any future grants or funds.</dd>
                    <dt>When will funds be disbursed? How often (one, two, or more disbursement periods?)</dt>
                    <dd>Disbursement timing and amounts will be determined according to the need of each project, but
                        typically
                        the disbursement of funds will start at the beginning of the year following the grant
                        application. For
                        example, grants submitted and awarded in 2014 will start receiving funds in early 2015. Most
                        grants
                        under $1,000 USD will receive a one-time payment. Most grants between $1,000 and $9,999 USD
                        receive two
                        separate payments. Grants $10,000 USD or above will have three or more disbursement periods.
                        Release of
                        each payment beyond the first installment will be based on the achievement of deliverables or
                        goals as
                        outlined in the submitted project.</dd>
                    <dt>Time limit for grants to be completed or funds used?</dt>
                    <dd>12 months, unless special permission is granted by Sustainable Med Executive Director and Board.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>How can grants be used for publicity?</dt>
                    <dd>Sustainable Med may include information about the award of this grant, including an individual’s
                        name,
                        in its publications, speaking engagements, tax returns and other public disclosures. Sustainable
                        Med may
                        also identify the other entities or NGOs with which grant awardees will collaborate. Individuals
                        receiving grants must request approval from Sustainable Med before any public use of our name or
                        mark/logo.</dd>
                    <dt>How do we process budget amendments or reallocation of funds?</dt>
                    <dd>All changes must be submitted to Sustainable Med and written approval must be received before
                        the
                        execution of budget amendments or reallocation of funds.</dd>
